## About

This project was started in 2020 by Felipe Galindo. It is a custom implementation of a Boston dynamics inspired spotMicro Robot.

Initially I printed a robot from this thingverse repository and physically sanded down things so it would fit together. 

The first versions were printed in PLA and were heavy, and inefficient. The latest implementation features low in-fill PETG, TPU, & Copper-filled contraction and is able to walk in somewhat unpredictable environments. 

## Versions
